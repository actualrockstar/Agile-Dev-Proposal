# Agile-Dev-Proposal

## Title
Social Network for Music

## What and Why?
My proposal is a social network of sorts based on sharing music. There isn't really a good music recommendation/discovery sites around. Youtube and Spotify recommend new music using algorithms and your listneing history but I've found that the recommendations aren't that diverse or interesting. A network where people connect with others who have similar taste would make music discovery a lot more personal and exciting. Listeners can find community online with other fans. 

## For Whom?
This could be for a range of people. Artists may want to share new music or the music that the were influcenced by. Fans can share and talk about their favorite artists and find people who share similar taste. Critics could share what they are reviewing or who they think people should be listening to. It could become a great tool within the music industry to track who is trending, what are people listening to, and what are people opinions. Businesses can post what they play in their stores. Labels could use it to promote their artists. It can be for anyone who wants to find and share music.

## How?
I imagine a tumblr like experience where the user logs in to see a feed of posts from those they like and repost clips they liked too. User profiles can become a playist of sorts or they could have the freedom to organize their posts into categories/playlists. 
 
## Scope
I think this project has the potential to be as ambitious as we make it. I imagine that a functional software could be made within the semester and the idea can always be improved upon.
